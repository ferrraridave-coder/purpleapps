        <h1>About Me - My Story</h1>

        <p class="intro">I operate a loading shovel in a quarry environment. I start at 6:30 AM, finish at 4:45 PM, and I've been doing it for fifteen years. By night—and weekends, and early mornings—I build iOS apps.</p>

        <p class="intro">Three months ago, I couldn't code. Now I have four apps, two live on the App Store, one in beta, and one waiting for review. I'm 56 years old. No computer science degree. No bootcamp. Just a £2,000 MacBook and a stubborn refusal to quit.</p>

        <p class="intro">This is how it happened.</p>

        <h2>The Problem That Started It All</h2>

        <p>I've always been into tech. Not just interested—obsessed. I'm the person who has to understand how things work, optimize everything, stay at the forefront. When AI came along, I didn't fear it like some people. I embraced it completely. I think it's the best thing ever invented.</p>

        <p>But there was a problem: the app I wanted didn't exist.</p>

        <p>I'd been looking for an AI chat app that did exactly what I needed—flexible, powerful, with a buttery-smooth interface. Everything I tried was close but not quite right. Too limited, clunky UI, missing features I needed. I was frustrated.</p>

        <p>I thought: "Why not just build it myself? How hard could it be?"</p>

        <p>Turns out, very hard. But I did it anyway.</p>

        <h2>The Terrified First Week</h2>

        <p>I bought a MacBook Pro for £2,000. That's when reality hit.</p>

        <p>GitHub scared me. Xcode scared me. The Apple Developer portal scared me. Vercel? Absolutely terrifying. I thought, "How on earth am I going to cope with all of this?"</p>

        <p>I didn't watch YouTube tutorials. I didn't read books. I just dove straight into building, completely lost and overwhelmed.</p>

        <p>But I'd already spent the money. I'd already committed. I gave myself no choice—no option to back out. That's the only reason I kept going that first week.</p>

        <h2>The Reality of the Grind</h2>

        <p>Here's what my schedule actually looks like:</p>

        <p><strong>Monday to Friday:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>5:00 AM: Code for an hour before work</li>
            <li>6:30 AM - 4:45 PM: Operate machinery</li>
            <li>6:00 PM - Midnight: Code</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Friday night:</strong> Code until 2 or 3 AM</p>

        <p><strong>Saturday:</strong> Wake up after 5 hours of sleep, code for 20 hours straight until 3 or 4 AM Sunday</p>

        <p><strong>Sunday:</strong> Another 5 hours of sleep, then code until midnight</p>

        <p>That's 75+ hours a week on top of a full-time job.</p>

        <p>The total investment so far? Around £3,000 for the MacBook, developer account, API costs, domains, and hosting. Plus another £4,000 in a separate business account to keep everything strictly separated for when services like Replicate and Vercel start billing.</p>

        <p>Why is this sustainable? Simple: I love it. I'm passionate about it. And I don't quit.</p>

        <h2>The Truth About AI</h2>

        <p>I've leaned heavily on AI for everything—debugging, learning concepts, writing code, architecture decisions, all of it. Let me be clear about that.</p>

        <p>But AI isn't magic. It can't think like a user. It can't experience an app the way a human does. Sometimes I find solutions AI simply couldn't come up with, because the human mind approaches problems differently.</p>

        <p>What AI <em>is</em> really good at is provoking deeper thinking. It pushes me, challenges me, makes me think harder. It's an incredible tool, but at the end of the day, the creativity and problem-solving? That's still human.</p>

        <h2>The Learning Curve</h2>

        <h3>App #1 - Chat LLM: 450 hours</h3>

        <p>My first app took me roughly 450 hours to build. It was a brutally steep learning curve. I built it because existing apps frustrated me, and it evolved into something far better than I'd originally imagined.</p>

        <p>The App Store rejections? They stung. But I stopped seeing them as failures and started seeing them as lessons. Apple was teaching me their language, their standards. I learned "Apple speak."</p>

        <h3>App #2 - VisuAIly: ~350 hours</h3>

        <p>Next, I wanted to generate AI images exactly how I wanted them—with the exact standards and configurations I needed. That became VisuAIly.</p>

        <p>But I wasn't just satisfied with functionality. It had to look beautiful. Liquid glass effects, transparency, polished to perfection. I don't rest until an app looks exactly how I've envisioned it.</p>

        <p>When I submitted VisuAIly to the App Store, my son said something that stuck with me: "It looks like tech has finally caught up to where you wanted to be."</p>

        <p>He was right.</p>

        <h3>App #3 - Microscope AI: 16 hours</h3>

        <p>This one happened because I was bored.</p>

        <p>I'd submitted builds for my other apps and had nothing to code. So on a Friday night around 8 PM, an idea hit me. By late Saturday night, I'd built and submitted Microscope AI to the App Store. It was approved on Sunday.</p>

        <p>450 hours for my first app. 16 hours for my third.</p>

        <p>That's when I knew I'd figured it out.</p>

        <p>I also realized Microscope AI could work as a free funnel into my paid apps—no ads, completely free, a tool for the AI community. Strategic thinking came as a side effect of being bored.</p>

        <h3>App #4 - Flash Image: 24 hours</h3>

        <p>The weekend of December 14-15, 2025, I built Flash Image in 24 hours. It's uploaded and waiting for review.</p>

        <h2>What I've Learned</h2>

        <p>I've learned that I'm capable of far more than I ever thought possible.</p>

        <p>Three months ago, I thought building an app meant: buy MacBook → write code in Xcode → upload to App Store. Done. That's it.</p>

        <p>I was so wrong. GitHub, Vercel, CloudKit, App Store Connect, Apple's guidelines, marketing, pricing strategy, backend architecture—the coding is only a small part of the whole process.</p>

        <p>But I learned it all. At 56 years old. While working full-time.</p>

        <p>I discovered I have a level of creativity I never knew existed. I'm good at problem-solving. I'm good at design. And I've learned that my apps need to do two things: solve real problems <em>and</em> look beautiful. Buttery smooth. Polished. No compromises.</p>

        <h2>The Goal</h2>

        <p>The goal is simple: become a full-time developer.</p>

        <p>Six months to a year is a realistic timeline. I'm building sustainable income, not chasing overnight success.</p>

        <p>What will I do when I'm finally full-time? Probably build another app. And keep improving the ones I've already built—perfection isn't actually possible, but we can strive to achieve it.</p>

        <p>I'm not interested in building a team. This is a one-man operation, and it always will be. I want to make my own decisions, work my own hours, and build something I can pass down to my granddaughter.</p>

        <p>The plan going forward? Keep making apps. Improve the existing ones. Find apps that frustrate me (or others), and build better versions without those frustrations. Solve problems. Keep going.</p>

        <h2>The Message</h2>

        <p>If you're reading this thinking, "I could never do that," I completely understand. I thought the same thing.</p>

        <p>I'm 56. No degree. Three months ago, GitHub terrified me. I work full-time operating heavy machinery. I had no idea what I was doing building apps.</p>

        <p>But I had passion, drive, and a refusal to quit.</p>

        <p>Don't give up when things get hard. The obstacles are there to test if you really want it. Keep going.</p>

        <p>Three months in, four apps built, and I'm just getting started.</p>
