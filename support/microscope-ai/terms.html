<h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
<p>
Microscope AI is a tool for exploring, analysing, and comparing AI models. The App retrieves
publicly available model information from online sources and uses a secure backend service
to request AI-generated analysis (such as summaries, traits, quirks, and bias indicators)
from third-party providers such as <strong>Groq</strong>.  
We do not operate, control, or guarantee the behaviour of any third-party AI models.
</p>

<h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>

    <li>Input sensitive personal data about others without permission;</li>
    <li>Interfere with, overload, or misuse any third-party AI provider or API;</li>
    <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, bypass, or disrupt the App's backend services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <li><strong>OpenRouter</strong> and other public catalogues — for retrieving publicly available model data;</li>

    <li>Indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Termination</h2>
<p>
