<h1>Privacy Policy for Microscope AI</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: 7 December 2025</strong></p>

<p>
Microscope AI is developed and maintained by <strong>David Picknell</strong> ("we", "us", "our").  
This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles your data and what information is transmitted
to external services.
</p>

</p>

<h2>1. Information You Provide</h2>
<p>Microscope AI allows you to create and manage model profiles, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Model names and providers</li>
    <li>Pricing, context window size, and other model details</li>
    <li>AI-generated summaries, traits, quirks, and bias notes</li>
    <li>Any optional notes or labels you choose to add yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>
This information is stored locally on your device using the app's data storage (for example, SwiftData)
and may be synchronised between your devices via Apple's iCloud/CloudKit services if you have iCloud
sync enabled for the app. We do not have access to your iCloud account or its contents.
</p>

<h2>2. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
<p>
When you request an analysis for a model, Microscope AI sends relevant text (such as the model name
and related description) to a secure backend service. That backend then forwards the request to
third-party AI providers such as <strong>Groq</strong> in order to generate:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Summaries of the model</li>
    <li>Traits and quirks</li>
    <li>Potential bias information</li>
</ul>

<p>
The results are returned to the app and can be saved in your local model profiles.
</p>

<p><strong>Microscope AI does not:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Ask you to enter or manage any API keys</li>
    <li>Create or manage user accounts within the app</li>
    <li>Include analytics SDKs or advertising trackers</li>
    <li>Sell your data or share it with advertisers</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services and Data Retention</h2>
<p>
Microscope AI relies on third-party services to function:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Groq</strong> — used to generate analysis (summaries, traits, quirks, and biases) for models.</li>
    <li><strong>OpenRouter and other public catalogues</strong> — used as sources of publicly available model information.</li>
    <li><strong>Vercel</strong> — used to host the backend service that communicates with Groq and fetches model data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
While Microscope AI itself does not maintain its own servers or databases for user accounts,
these third parties may log or store data (for example IP addresses, request metadata, or error logs)
in accordance with their own policies. You should review those policies to understand how your
data is handled by them:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Groq:</strong> <a href="https://groq.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://groq.com/privacy-policy</a></li>
    <li><strong>OpenRouter:</strong> <a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy" target="_blank">https://openrouter.ai/privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Vercel:</strong> <a href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
By using Microscope AI, you acknowledge that any data sent to these providers is subject to their
respective terms and privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>4. No Tracking or Behavioural Profiling</h2>
<p>
Microscope AI does not include third-party analytics SDKs or ad networks and does not track your
behaviour across other apps or websites. We do not build marketing profiles of users.
</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>
All communication between the app, the backend service, and third-party AI providers is transmitted
over HTTPS using industry-standard encryption. However, no method of transmission over the internet
is entirely risk-free, and you should avoid entering highly sensitive or confidential information
into the app.
</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
Because Microscope AI stores model profiles primarily on your device (and, if enabled, in your own
iCloud account), you can manage most of your data directly:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Delete saved model profiles within the app</li>
    <li>Disable iCloud sync for the app in your device settings if you do not want data to sync across devices</li>
</ul>

<p>
Any data that may be stored or logged by third-party providers (such as Groq, OpenRouter, or Vercel)
is managed under their own privacy policies. Where applicable, you may need to contact those providers
directly to exercise rights such as access or deletion.
</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>
<p>
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact:<br>
<strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:ferrraridave@icloud.com">ferrraridave@icloud.com</a>
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available on
this page. Continued use of Microscope AI after changes are posted means you accept the updated Policy.
