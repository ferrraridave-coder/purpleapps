</p>
<h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
<p>
Chat LLM is a client application that allows you to interact with AI models provided by
third-party services such as OpenRouter and OpenAI. The App sends your text, images,
and documents to these providers' APIs and displays the responses returned.
We do not operate or control the models themselves.
</p>
<h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
You agree that you will not use the App to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Upload or generate content that is illegal, harmful, or abusive;</li>
    <li>Violate intellectual property rights or privacy rights of others;</li>
    <li>Submit sensitive personal data of others without consent;</li>
    <li>Misuse, overload, or attempt to interfere with third-party AI services or APIs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App relies on APIs provided by third parties, including but not limited to OpenRouter and OpenAI.
Your use of those services is also governed by their own terms and privacy policies, which you are
responsible for reviewing:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>OpenRouter: <a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy">https://openrouter.ai/privacy</a></li>
    <li>OpenAI: <a href="https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/">https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
We are not responsible for the availability, performance, or behaviour of these third-party services.
</p>
<h2>4. No Guarantee of AI Output</h2>
<p>
AI-generated responses may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. We do not guarantee
the correctness, reliability, or suitability of any output produced by third-party models.
You are responsible for how you use and interpret AI output.
</p>
<h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any loss or damage arising from your reliance on AI-generated content;</li>
    <li>Service interruptions, rate limits, or unavailability of third-party providers;</li>
    <li>Loss or exposure of content sent to third-party services;</li>
    <li>Indirect, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Termination</h2>
<p>
We may suspend or restrict your access to the App if we reasonably believe you are misusing it
or violating these Terms. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your devices.
</p>
<h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>
We may update these Terms from time to time. The latest version will always be available on this page.
Continued use of the App after changes are posted means you accept the updated Terms.
</p>
<h2>8. Contact</h2>
