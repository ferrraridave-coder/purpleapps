<h1>Privacy Policy for Chat LLM</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: 7 December 2025</strong></p>

</p>
<h2>1. Information You Provide</h2>
<p>Chat LLM allows you to input and upload:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Text prompts</li>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Documents (for example, text or PDF files)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This content is used only to generate responses from third-party AI providers.
Chat LLM does <strong>not</strong> store your prompts, images, or documents on its own servers.
</p>
<h2>2. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
<p>
When you send a message or upload content, Chat LLM securely transmits this data to
third-party AI services such as <strong>OpenRouter</strong> and/or <strong>OpenAI</strong>, depending on the model you select.
These services process your request and return an AI-generated response, which is displayed in the app.
</p>
<p><strong>Chat LLM does not:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Store your prompts or uploaded content</li>
    <li>Create or manage user accounts</li>
    <li>Collect analytics or tracking data</li>
    <li>Sell or share data with advertisers</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Third-Party Data Retention</h2>
<p>
While Chat LLM does not retain your content, the third-party providers may store or log data
in accordance with their own policies. You should review those policies to understand how your
data is handled:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>OpenRouter:</strong> <a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy">https://openrouter.ai/privacy</a></li>
    <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> <a href="https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/">https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
By using Chat LLM, you acknowledge that any data sent to these providers is subject to their
respective terms and privacy policies.
</p>
<h2>4. No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
<p>
Chat LLM does not include analytics SDKs, advertising trackers, or other third-party tracking tools.
We do not build profiles of users or track behaviour across apps or websites.
</p>
<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>
All communication with third-party AI providers is transmitted over HTTPS using industry-standard
encryption. However, no method of transmission over the internet is entirely risk-free, and you
should avoid sending highly sensitive or confidential information through the app.
</p>
<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
Because Chat LLM does not store personal data or content, there is no user data held by us to access,
export, or delete. Any data stored by third-party providers would be managed according to their
policies, and you would need to contact them directly where applicable.
</p>
<h2>7. Contact</h2>
<p>
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact:<br>
<strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:ferrraridave@icloud.com">ferrraridave@icloud.com</a>
</p>
<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available on
this page. Continued use of Chat LLM after changes are posted means you accept the updated Policy.
